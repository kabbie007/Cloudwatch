## This code will delete any rule in your eventbridge that does not have any targets

## Make sure you are in the appropriate region and also give your Lambda or Machine the needed IAM permissions to perform the following API calls on your default bus and rules in it. You can modify the bus as well if needed.
## API calls permissions required are: (list_rules,list_targets_by_rule,delete_rule)
## Resources eventbridge bus and rules in the region where you are running the API calls for.
